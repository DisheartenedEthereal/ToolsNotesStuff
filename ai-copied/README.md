### This is the AI project i'm working on

It should be :
  Python machine learning models => C++ Bindings and api => X frontend | x = flutter OR electronJS
  

  this is the image im going for:
    A user pays a subscription, the models learn from various sources that the user needs to implement (ex. Instagram, Web trackers, etc), the models give suggestions based on the data collected.
    Ex : Based on the gender and age of their instagram followers [from the facebook api](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/insights), alongside the field of their work, the model analyises best social media posts, their hashtags and decides what's making that post stand out, then it'd suggest it to the user alongside other interesting things that the consumer might need, for example, a news panel consisting of shit that is actually happening and is related to their field of work and user's interest.

    the image is vague and can be pushed further, in short, my image is an enourmously bloated piece of HelperAI

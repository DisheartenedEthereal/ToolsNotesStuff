This is a toolchain made as a service to make coding on a linux easier, this was made for personal adjusments so i will eventually add a rather powerful configuration system to match your needs, it is developed in C++ for the best performance



## Features / TODO

- Provide automatic night/day themes based of system time TODO
- Automatic updates with configurable intervals TODO
- Check and log performance issues TODO


> This is made on an arch machine and will probably only support arch-based packages as a default Ex: pacman updates

### Docs


# Basic file structre 
![](https://github.com/DisheartenedEthereal/ai/blob/master/docs/file_tree.png?raw=true)

- assets : non code files
- bindings : C++ bindings, crawlers, APIs, etc
- docs : docs and doc assets
- models : machine learning models

- Makefile, Unit_tests.py, README.md, => obvious.

i will mimic the file structre here, instead of files, its gonna be docs.

#1:	
	Infect:
		using usb on lin
		using usb on win
		fuck mac

	runfile:
		a nice user friendly(more like enemily lmao) interface
		optimize code
		need to export exe file
		
	TBE:
		needs rename
		needs protcol to transfer the key with encryption
		needs a way to execlude file formats
		needs some intelligence to not fuck up the os and make it unusable
		needs to add a shortcut to the runfile in every folder it encrypts
		needs some speed meters and some estimations
	
	writekey:
		TBE(2)
	key:
		needs salt, needs more encryption, needs a .noxkey file
	isoset:
		isolation needs more realism, perhaps a wine setup or some apps installed.
	cliframe:
		needs to be removed and merged into runfile
	autorun.inf:
		needs a new autorun system to be ignored by antiviruses

	Lest discuss ideas:
		- we need an algorithm to spread this through the network
		check "Worms"
		- we need an algorithm to spread this through external data:
			- emails
			- documents 
			- exe files
			- ETC
		- we also need a controller of some sort, probably a system using email servers, altough i think it will me much more efficient to just use a anonymos hosting, maybe even onion services
		- we also need a front page in the onion services to redirect the victims to purchase sites.
		- executables for win32 (EXE) and linux (Probably compiled machine code.)
		- maybe eveen extend to DARwin at some point, not impossible altough i lack a system to test it on

	Testing conditions:
		- WIN7,32 / 64 bit should be tested (most important os)
		- winSERVER x86 should be tested just in case we run into servers
		- to stop "super-spreading" we should leave win 8 alone
		- windows 10 should'nt really be tested, in theory it should just work.
		- linux:
		- arch-family, kali, ubuntu, centos
		- debian will be a target too
		- ubuntu should just work as debian does, same goes for mint or really any deb based distro
		- redhat family seems important, altough i have no fucking idea what os are servers at iran are running.
		- centos probably
		- i need to create a spread condition through virtual machines and check how well does it work
	IRL testing:
		- i need to find a small network to inject this in, knowing i wont spread it too far.
		- i need to monitor spread patterns so it does not just "fail"
